## Ongoing Projects:

### [MTG Cards Image Detection App](https://github.com/gruzdev-as/MTG-Cards-Image-Detection-Based-on-Embedding-Approach)

The application for identifying and cataloging MTG playing cards, using CLIP-based image embeddings with Open-CV implemented algorithims and a vector HNSW search. Using Flask for online implementation.

## Hacks and Competitions: 

### [NLP_DLS_Workshop_Competition (1-st Place)](https://github.com/gruzdev-as/NLP_DLS_Workshop_Competition)

A solo work within the framework of the workshop from DLS. The task of multilabel classification of feedback from users. 

Obtained best score on the public leaderboard using quantized LLM Gemma-2-27b with LoRA adapter, finetuned for multilabel classification. Packaged the solution using Docker and Streamlit.

### [Product cards matching. Ozon Tech E-CUP (2nd Place)](https://github.com/gruzdev-as/ozon-ecup-matching)
A model was developed that determined by names, attributes and pictures whether two products were the same. This solution will help Ozon customers to improve the user experience, and companies to optimize resources and save on the purchase of server equipment.

Was involved in training final gradient boosting models, logging experiments in mlflow, building submission pipelines in a docker container and was helping in other ad-hoc tasks. Presented the solution to the case holder at pitching.

### [Mediawise Creative Filter. Digital Breakthrought 2024. (3-rd Place)](https://github.com/gruzdev-as/mediawise-creative-filter)

As part of a hackathon with the GNU MISIS team, a system was developed that predicts which segment (Segment_num) a given creative (Advertisement ID) belongs to.

I was involved in classifying video segments by their embeddings obtained using the XCLIP network, as well as developing theories and concepts for the generative neural network LLaVa. Presented the solution to the case holder at pitching.

### [IT Purple Hack: Churn Prediction case from SBER (4-th Place)](https://github.com/gruzdev-as/IT-Purple-Hack) 

As part of the hackathon with the "MISIS and Mr. Smith" team was presenting the idea of a project to use models of varying sensitivity to be able to flexibly adjust the ratio of expended resources and potentially retained clients.

I built a CatBoostClassifier model, the hyperparameters of which were selected using the Optuna library, thanks to which it was possible to achieve the value of the ROC_AUC metric = 0.77+, which allowed us to take 5-th place on the public and 8-th place on the private leaderboard according to the results of the hackathon.

### [Dice Value Recognition: the Computer Vision Project (CV pet-project)](https://github.com/gruzdev-as/Dice_recognition.The-computer-vision-project) 

A set of Jupyter notebooks for training various computer vision models to classify and recognize dice of different configurations and face values. Full support of the project was carried out, starting from setting the technical specifications, to comparing the results obtained from different models, validating the results and drawing conclusions.
