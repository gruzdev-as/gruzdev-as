## Pinned Projects: 

### [Mediawise Creative Filter. Digital Breakthrought 2024. (3-rd Place)](https://github.com/gruzdev-as/mediawise-creative-filter)

As part of a hackathon with the GNU MISIS team, a system was developed that predicts which segment (Segment_num) a given creative (Advertisement ID) belongs to.

I was involved in classifying video segments by their embeddings obtained using the XCLIP network, as well as developing theories and concepts for the generative neural network LLaVa. Presented the solution to the case holder at pitching.

### [IT Purple Hack: Churn Prediction case from SBER (4-th Place)](https://github.com/gruzdev-as/IT-Purple-Hack) 

As part of the hackathon with the "MISIS and Mr. Smith" team was presenting the idea of a project to use models of varying sensitivity to be able to flexibly adjust the ratio of expended resources and potentially retained clients.

I built a CatBoostClassifier model, the hyperparameters of which were selected using the Optuna library, thanks to which it was possible to achieve the value of the ROC_AUC metric = 0.77+, which allowed us to take 5-th place on the public and 8-th place on the private leaderboard according to the results of the hackathon.

### [Dice Value Recognition: the Computer Vision Project (CV pet-project)](https://github.com/gruzdev-as/Dice_recognition.The-computer-vision-project) 

A set of Jupyter notebooks for training various computer vision models to classify and recognize dice of different configurations and face values. Full support of the project was carried out, starting from setting the technical specifications, to comparing the results obtained from different models, validating the results and drawing conclusions. 

### [Digital Breakthrough 2022: Tula](https://github.com/gruzdev-as/Tula_Digital_Breakthrough)

My attempt to solve the issue within the framework of the Digital Breakthrough 2022 championship (Tula) - Creation of a model for predicting population diseases. During the work, data analysis, preprocessing and cleaning were carried out. Cross-validation has been implemented while preserving the time structure. The use of gradient boosting was considered as a basis for the solution; however, this did not give good results due to the peculiarities of the modelâ€™s operation and its inadequacy for solving problems of this class. Despite this, the work presents a basic pipeline for solving the problem.
