## Pinned Projects: 
### [Gagarin_Hack: Document classifier (2-nd Place)](https://github.com/gruzdev-as/gagarin-hack-document-reader)
As part of the MISIS team, status.md took second place in the hackathon. He took the place of ML engineer in the team and presented the solution

Was involved in the creation and optimization of pipeline training for computer vision models of the YOLO family, as well as the RezNet model for multilabel classification. Also made it to achieve the classification accuracy above 98%, as well as high model stability.


### [IT Purple Hack: Churn Prediction case from SBER (4-th Place)](https://github.com/gruzdev-as/IT-Purple-Hack) 

As part of the hackathon with the "MISIS and Mr. Smith" team was presenting the idea of a project to use models of varying sensitivity to be able to flexibly adjust the ratio of expended resources and potentially retained clients.

I built a CatBoostClassifier model, the hyperparameters of which were selected using the Optuna library, thanks to which it was possible to achieve the value of the ROC_AUC metric = 0.77+, which allowed us to take 5-th place on the public and 8-th place on the private leaderboard according to the results of the hackathon.

The repository contains code for reproducing the main solution, as well as for testing various hypotheses, selecting features, etc. The presentation, the team and other information is presented in the repository

### [Dice Value Recognition: the Computer Vision Project (CV pet-project)](https://github.com/gruzdev-as/Dice_recognition.The-computer-vision-project) 

A set of Jupyter notebooks for training various computer vision models to classify and recognize dice of different configurations and face values. Full support of the project was carried out, starting from setting the technical specifications, to comparing the results obtained from different models, validating the results and drawing conclusions. 

### [Digital Breakthrough 2022: Tula](https://github.com/gruzdev-as/Tula_Digital_Breakthrough)

My attempt to solve the issue within the framework of the Digital Breakthrough 2022 championship (Tula) - Creation of a model for predicting population diseases. During the work, data analysis, preprocessing and cleaning were carried out. Cross-validation has been implemented while preserving the time structure. The use of gradient boosting was considered as a basis for the solution; however, this did not give good results due to the peculiarities of the modelâ€™s operation and its inadequacy for solving problems of this class. Despite this, the work presents a basic pipeline for solving the problem.
