## Pinned Projects: 
### [Dice Value Recognition: the Computer Vision Project](https://github.com/gruzdev-as/Dice_recognition.The-computer-vision-project) 

A set of Jupyter notebooks for training various computer vision models to classify and recognize dice of different configurations and face values. Full support of the project was carried out, starting from setting the technical specifications, to comparing the results obtained from different models, validating the results and drawing conclusions. 

### [Digital Breakthrough 2022: Tula](https://github.com/gruzdev-as/Tula_Digital_Breakthrough)

My attempt to solve the issue within the framework of the Digital Breakthrough 2022 championship (Tula) - Creation of a model for predicting population diseases. During the work, data analysis, preprocessing and cleaning were carried out. Cross-validation has been implemented while preserving the time structure. The use of gradient boosting was considered as a basis for the solution; however, this did not give good results due to the peculiarities of the modelâ€™s operation and its inadequacy for solving problems of this class. Despite this, the work presents a basic pipeline for solving the problem.
